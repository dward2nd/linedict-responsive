This is a mini-project made for adding responsive support to [LINE Dict](https://dict.naver.com/linedict). I got inspired from my personal problem when needing to search for a meaning and read an article in the same time. But [LINE Dict](https://dict.naver.com/linedict) doesn't support *responsive design*, which makes me upset. 

Note: The code runs on Tampermonkey, Chrome extension.
